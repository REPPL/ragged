## Overview

This document explains why ragged uses a versioned development approach and how each version builds on the previous one.

## Coming Soon

This document will cover:

### Why Versioned Development?
- Iterative improvement philosophy
- Progressive disclosure in implementation
- Risk management and validation
- User feedback integration

### Version Progression
- **v0.1**: Basic functionality and proof of concept
- **v0.2**: Web interface and usability
- **v0.3**: Enhanced processing and understanding
- **v0.4**: Self-improvement and confidence
- **v0.5**: Knowledge graphs and relationships
- **v1.0**: Production-ready and stable

### Design Principles
- Each version delivers value
- No throwaway code
- Backwards compatibility when possible
- Breaking changes only before v1.0

### Learning from Each Version
- Evaluation and metrics
- User feedback loops
- Technical debt management
- Architecture evolution

### Comparison with Alternatives
- Big bang releases
- Continuous delivery
- Feature flags
- Why versioning works for ragged
