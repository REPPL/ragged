# RAG Fundamentals


## Overview

This document explains the fundamental concepts behind Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and why they're important for document question-answering.

## Coming Soon

This document will cover:

### What is RAG?
- The retrieval-augmented generation paradigm
- How RAG differs from traditional search
- How RAG differs from standalone LLMs
- Why RAG is ideal for document QA

### Core RAG Components
- **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information
  - Document processing and chunking
  - Embedding generation
  - Vector similarity search
  - Hybrid retrieval strategies

- **Augmentation**: Enriching the context
  - Context assembly
  - Prompt engineering
  - Metadata integration

- **Generation**: Creating responses
  - LLM inference
  - Citation and attribution
  - Answer validation

### RAG Pipeline
- Document ingestion flow
- Query processing workflow
- Retrieval and ranking
- Response generation

### Advanced RAG Techniques (2025)
- Self-RAG: Self-reflective retrieval
- GraphRAG: Knowledge graph integration
- Adaptive RAG: Dynamic strategy selection
- Multi-hop reasoning

### RAG Challenges
- Retrieval quality and relevance
- Context window limitations
- Hallucination mitigation
- Performance optimisation

### Evaluation
- Retrieval metrics (precision, recall, MRR)
- Generation metrics (faithfulness, relevance)
- End-to-end evaluation
- Human evaluation
