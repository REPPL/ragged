# Implementation Documentation

This directory tracks the planning and eventual implementation of the ragged project.

## Structure

### [plan/](./plan/)
**Complete implementation plan** organised by version (v0.1 through v1.0).

Contains:
- State-of-the-art RAG architecture for 2025
- Version-specific implementation guides
- Technology stack decisions
- Core concepts and fundamentals
- Advanced features documentation

**Status**: Planning phase - no code implemented yet

### actual/ (Not yet created)
**Will be created during implementation** to document what was actually built, organised by version.

Will contain:
- Implementation notes for each version
- Deviations from the plan
- Lessons learned
- Performance metrics
- Testing results

**Status**: Not yet created - will be added when implementation begins

## Current Phase

**Phase**: Planning
**Version**: v0.0 (pre-implementation)
**Next Step**: Begin v0.1 implementation

## Navigation

- **[Implementation Plan →](./plan/)** - Complete planning documentation
- **[← Back to docs](../README.md)** - Main documentation index

**Note**: The implementation will follow the plan in [plan/](./plan/), with each version's actual implementation documented as it's completed.
