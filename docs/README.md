## Welcome

This is the complete documentation for **ragged**, a privacy-first local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. The documentation serves multiple audiences:

- **End Users:** Learn to use ragged for document question-answering
- **Contributors:** Understand how to contribute code and documentation
- **Developers:** See how ragged is designed and built
- **Researchers:** Study AI-assisted development and RAG architecture

---

## Documentation Structure

ragged's documentation follows industry-standard patterns with some unique additions for development transparency and research.

- ADR system implemented for architectural decisions
- Clear separation of design vs. implementation vs. process

---

## Documentation Standards

### Status Indicators

All documentation uses consistent status indicators to show implementation state:

- ✅ **Implemented** - Feature is complete and available in current version
- 🚧 **In Progress** - Feature is being actively developed in current version
- 📋 **Planned** - Feature is designed and scheduled for a future version
- 🔬 **Research** - Feature is in exploratory/experimental phase
- ⚠️ **Deprecated** - Feature is legacy and will be removed in future version
- 🔄 **Current Focus** - Highlighted area of active development

**Usage Examples:**
```markdown
## Features

- ✅ Basic RAG pipeline (v0.1)
- ✅ Web UI with Gradio (v0.2)
- 🚧 Document normalisation (v0.2 - in progress)
- 📋 Personal memory system (v0.3 - planned)
- 🔬 Self-RAG evaluation (v0.4 - research)
```

When documenting planned features, always indicate which version they target.

### Language

**British English** throughout all documentation:
- "organise" not "organize"
- "colour" not "color"
- "behaviour" not "behavior"

### Formatting

**Metadata formatting:**
```markdown
**Status:** Active

**Date:** 2025-11-13

**Owner:** Engineering
```

Each metadata field on its own line for readability.

**File naming:**
- Lowercase with hyphens: `architecture-overview.md`
- README.md exception: All caps (standard convention)
- Avoid capitals for normal files: `summary.md` not `summary.md`

### Version Control

- All documentation version-controlled in git
- Major milestones tagged (e.g., `v0.1-complete`)
- Compare plans ([planning/version/](./development/planning/version/)) against actuals ([implementation/](./development/implementation/))

### AI Transparency

ragged development uses AI tools (Claude Code) transparently:
- AI usage disclosed in commits and documentation
- Time tracking distinguishes AI-assisted vs. manual work
- All AI-generated code reviewed and understood by humans
- See [AI Assistance Guidelines](./development/process/methodology/ai-assistance.md)

---

## Project Principles

### 1. Privacy-First

All processing 100% local by default. No external APIs unless explicitly configured.

**See:** [ADR-0001: Local-Only Processing](./development/decisions/adrs/0001-local-only-processing.md)

### 2. Learning-Focused

Documentation prioritises educational value. Explain "why", not just "what".

### 3. State-of-the-Art

Incorporate latest 2025 RAG research and best practices.

### 4. Modular Architecture

Pluggable components with clear interfaces. Easy to experiment and extend.

**See:** [Modularity](./development/planning/core-concepts/modularity.md)

### 5. Progressive Enhancement

Build incrementally. Each version adds capabilities without breaking previous work.

### 6. Transparent Development

Document the actual development process, including AI assistance, for reproducibility.

**See:** [Process Documentation](./development/process/)
