# Feature Time Logs

**Status**: 🚧 Awaiting Content
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-09

## Overview

This directory contains detailed time tracking logs for specific features and implementations, providing transparency about development effort and AI assistance.

---

## Purpose

Feature time logs provide:
- **Effort Estimation**: Actual time spent on features
- **AI Transparency**: AI vs human effort breakdown
- **Learning**: Efficiency insights and improvements
- **Planning**: Better estimation for future features

---

## Log Format

Each log follows the template at [feature-time-log-template.md](../templates/feature-time-log-template.md) and includes:

1. **Feature Name**: What was built
2. **Version**: Which version it's part of
3. **Status**: In Progress, Complete, On Hold
4. **Total Time**: Hours spent
5. **AI Breakdown**: AI vs human time split
6. **Sessions**: Detailed session logs
7. **Outcomes**: What was delivered

---

## File Naming

Feature logs are named descriptively:
```
feature-name.md
```

For example:
- `document-processor.md`
- `web-ui-basic.md`
- `hybrid-retrieval.md`

---

## Coming Soon

Feature logs will be created as significant features are implemented, starting with v0.1.

Expected logs:
- Document ingestion pipeline
- Embedding and vector storage
- Basic retrieval engine
- CLI interface
- Web UI foundation (v0.2)
