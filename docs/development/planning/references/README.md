# References

This folder contains curated references, research materials, and external resources that inform Ragged's design and implementation.

## Overview

The references collection includes academic papers, technical articles, and research findings that support key architectural decisions and implementation approaches. These materials provide the theoretical foundation and practical insights for building a state-of-the-art RAG system.

## How to Use These References

These documents serve multiple purposes:

1. **Architecture Decisions**: Justifying technology and design choices
2. **Implementation Guidance**: Practical patterns and best practices
3. **Evaluation Methods**: Metrics and testing approaches
4. **Future Research**: Areas for exploration in later versions

## Adding New References

When adding new reference materials:

1. **Categorize appropriately**: Research papers vs. implementation guides
2. **Summarize key insights**: Don't just list - explain relevance
3. **Link to decisions**: Connect references to ADRs and architecture docs
4. **Keep current**: Update as new research emerges
