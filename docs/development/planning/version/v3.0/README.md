# ragged v3.0+ Planning - Ecosystem & Advanced Capabilities

**Status**: Strategic Planning
**Total Estimated Hours**: 850-1250 hours (across multiple releases)
**Target Timeline**: After v2.0, community-driven priorities
**Focus**: Plugin ecosystem, federation, AI agents, mobile apps

---

## Vision Statement

ragged v3.0+ transforms from a product into a **platform**, enabling community innovation through plugins, federated knowledge sharing, autonomous AI agents, and mobile-first experiences.

**Approach**: Modular releases based on user demand and community contributions.

---

## Strategic Options

### v3.0: Plugin Marketplace (150-250 hours)

**Concept**: ragged as extensible platform with community plugins.

**Features**:
- Plugin API (hooks for customization)
- Marketplace (discover, install, update plugins)
- Plugin sandboxing (security isolation)
- Optional revenue sharing (paid plugins)

**Use Cases**:
- Custom embedders (domain-specific: legal, medical, code)
- Specialized retrievers
- Integration plugins (Zotero, Obsidian sync, Notion import)
- UI themes and custom layouts

**Precedents**: Obsidian (1000+ plugins), VS Code extensions

---

### v3.1: Federated Sharing (200-300 hours)

**Concept**: Users host personal instances, selectively share with trusted network.

**Features**:
- Personal instance ownership
- Cryptographic trust model
- Selective federation (share with trusted peers only)
- ActivityPub or custom protocol

**Use Cases**:
- Research collaborations (share without centralization)
- Academic networks (federated knowledge graphs)
- Professional networks (controlled sharing)

**Precedents**: Mastodon (social), Matrix (messaging)

**Alignment**: Extends ragged's local-first, privacy-first philosophy

---

### v3.2: AI Agents & Automation (200-300 hours)

**Concept**: Autonomous AI assistants that execute multi-step tasks.

**Features**:
- Autonomous research (find and synthesize papers on topic)
- Scheduled digests (daily/weekly summaries)
- Proactive suggestions (surface relevant past work)
- Workflow automation (trigger actions based on events)
- Multi-step reasoning (complex task decomposition)

**Use Cases**:
- Research assistant (literature review automation)
- Knowledge curator (organize and tag automatically)
- Learning assistant (spaced repetition scheduling)
- Writing assistant (draft generation, editing)

**Precedents**: Notion AI Agents (September 2025), Anthropic Claude with MCP

**Competitive Necessity**: Notion has agents; ragged must match or exceed.

---

### v3.3: Mobile Applications (300-400 hours)

**Concept**: Native mobile apps (iOS + Android) as primary interface option.

**Features**:
- React Native or Flutter apps
- Voice-first capture (speech-to-text)
- Offline-first with sync
- Camera-based capture (documents, whiteboards, receipts)
- Location-aware notes
- Mobile-optimized UI

**Use Cases**:
- Field research (scientists, journalists)
- Meeting notes (capture away from desk)
- Reading on-the-go
- Quick capture workflows

**Market Opportunity**: Mobile knowledge management is massive market

## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Sequence

1. **v3.0: Plugin Marketplace** (150-250h)
   - Enables community innovation immediately
   - Reduces core team burden (community builds features)
   - Revenue opportunity (marketplace fees)

2. **v3.1: Federated Sharing** (200-300h)
   - Unique differentiator
   - Aligns with privacy values
   - Enables academic/research use cases

3. **v3.2: AI Agents** (200-300h)
   - Natural evolution of v0.4 personal memory
   - Competitive necessity
   - High value-add

4. **v3.3: Mobile Apps** (300-400h)
   - Completes platform coverage
   - Mainstream market requirement
   - Consider last due to high cost

### Community-Driven Approach

**Key principle**: Let users guide v3.x priorities through:
- Annual user surveys
- Feature voting
- Plugin marketplace analytics (what's popular?)
- Partnership opportunities

**Flexibility**: Order can change based on demand and resources.
