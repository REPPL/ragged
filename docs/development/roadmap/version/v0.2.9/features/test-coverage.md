# Test Coverage Improvements

**Phase**: 3 | **Effort**: 6-8h | **Priority**: MUST-HAVE

**Target**: 90%+ overall, 95%+ critical paths

**Tasks**:
1. Measure current coverage
2. Identify gaps
3. Write unit tests for uncovered code
4. Add property-based tests (hypothesis)
5. Add concurrent operation tests
6. Long-running stability tests

**Tools**:
- pytest-cov for coverage
- hypothesis for property testing
- pytest-xdist for parallel tests

**Success**: 90%+ coverage, all critical paths 95%+

**Timeline**: 6-8h
