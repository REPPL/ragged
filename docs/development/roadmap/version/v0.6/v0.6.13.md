# v0.6.13: Security & Production Readiness

**Focus:** Security hardening and production deployment preparation

**Hours:** 20-25 hours

**Dependencies:** v0.6.12 (All features documented)

**Status:** Planned

---

## Overview

Version 0.6.13 hardens the system for production deployment with security audits, vulnerability remediation, production configuration, monitoring setup, and deployment documentation. This version ensures the system is ready for real-world use.

**What This Version Delivers:**
- Security audit and vulnerability remediation
- Production configuration and environment setup
- API security hardening (authentication, rate limiting, CORS)
- Data privacy compliance measures
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Deployment guides (Docker, Kubernetes)

---

## Key Features

### Security Hardening

**API Security:**
- API key encryption and secure storage
- Rate limiting enforcement and DDoS protection
- CORS policy tightening
- Request validation and sanitisation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

**Data Security:**
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- Secure API key generation (cryptographically secure)
- Session management hardening
- Input validation across all endpoints

**Dependency Security:**
- Vulnerability scanning (npm audit, pip check)
- Dependency updates for security patches
- License compliance verification
- CVE monitoring setup

### Production Configuration

**Environment Management:**
- Production environment variables template
- Configuration validation
- Secrets management (environment-based)
- Feature flags for gradual rollout

**Performance Optimisation:**
- Database connection pooling
- API response caching headers
- Static asset optimisation
- Gzip compression configuration

### Monitoring & Observability

**Logging:**
- Structured logging setup
- Log aggregation configuration
- Error tracking (Sentry integration optional)
- Audit logging for security events

**Monitoring:**
- Health check endpoints
- Performance monitoring
- Resource usage tracking
- Alerting rules setup

### Deployment Preparation

**Docker Production Setup:**
- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Production Dockerfile optimisation
- Docker Compose production configuration
- Container security scanning

**Kubernetes Deployment (Optional):**
- Kubernetes manifests
- Helm chart creation
- Resource limits and requests
- Horizontal pod autoscaling

---

## Implementation

**Phase 1: Security Audit & Hardening (8-10h)**
- Security vulnerability scanning
- API security hardening
- Data encryption implementation
- Dependency security updates

**Phase 2: Production Configuration (6-8h)**
- Environment configuration setup
- Performance optimisation
- Monitoring and logging setup
- Feature flag implementation

**Phase 3: Deployment Preparation (6-7h)**
- Docker production setup
- Deployment documentation
- Kubernetes manifests (optional)
- Deployment testing
