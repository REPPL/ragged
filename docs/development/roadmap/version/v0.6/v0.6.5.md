# v0.6.5: Experimental - Speculative RAG

**Focus:** Draft-verify optimisation (experimental feature)

**Hours:** 25-35 hours

**Dependencies:** v0.6.1 (Model routing required)

**Status:** Planned (Experimental)

---

## Overview

Version 0.6.5 implements Speculative RAG based on Google Research's approach - smaller specialist model drafts response, larger generalist model verifies and corrects if needed.

**What This Version Delivers:**
- OPTIMISE-010: Speculative RAG (25-35h)

**⚠️ Experimental Status:** Validate quality before production use. May be skipped if quality doesn't meet standards.

## Feature: OPTIMISE-010 Speculative RAG (25-35 hours)

**Model Pairing:**
- **Draft Model:** `llama3.2:3b` (fast, ~500 tokens/sec)
- **Verify Model:** `llama3.2:70b` (quality, ~50 tokens/sec)

**Expected Performance:**
- Simple queries: 80% latency reduction (draft accepted)
- Medium queries: 40-60% reduction (partial verification)
- Complex queries: No reduction (full regeneration)
- **Overall:** 30-50% average latency reduction

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] 30-50% average latency reduction
- [ ] No accuracy loss
- [ ] Draft acceptance rate 60-70%
- [ ] Graceful degradation on failure

---

## Quality Validation Required

**Before Production:**
- [ ] Accuracy validation against baseline
- [ ] User feedback integration
- [ ] Configurable acceptance thresholds tested
- [ ] Automatic fallback to single-model verified

**If Quality Insufficient:**
- Feature may be disabled or deferred
- System remains functional without it
- Can be revisited in later versions
