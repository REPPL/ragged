# ragged v0.1 Development Log

**Status:** ✅ Core Implementation Complete
**Coverage**: 96% (Phase 1 baseline)
**Total Phases**: 8 of 14 completed
**Version**: 0.1.0

## Quick Overview

ragged v0.1 establishes the foundation for a privacy-first local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. This development log documents the complete journey from planning through implementation, organised by concerns for easy navigation and future reference.

### What Was Delivered

✅ **Chunking System**: Semantic-aware recursive splitting with token counting
✅ **Embeddings**: Dual model support (sentence-transformers + Ollama)
✅ **Vector Storage**: ChromaDB integration with full CRUD operations
✅ **Retrieval**: Semantic similarity search with top-k selection
✅ **Generation**: Ollama LLM client with RAG prompts and citation extraction
✅ **CLI Interface**: Complete command-line interface with Rich formatting
✅ **Foundation**: Pydantic settings, privacy-safe logging, security utilities

## Navigation by Concern

This development log is organised by three primary concerns: **Planning**, **Implementation**, and **Retrospective**. This structure separates what we intended to do, what we actually did, and what we learned.

### 📋 Planning (What We Intended)

Documents capturing initial plans, scope, and structure:

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[timeline.md](timeline.md)** | Development timeline, phase breakdown, time estimates |
| **[phases.md](phases.md)** | Detailed phase-by-phase plan with goals and deliverables |

### 🔨 Implementation (What We Did)

Documents tracking actual development work and decisions:

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[structure.md](structure.md)** | Project structure, organisation, and module layout |
| **[decisions.md](decisions.md)** | Architecture Decision Records (why key choices were made) |
| **[implementation-notes.md](implementation-notes.md)** | Technical implementation details, patterns, and solutions |

### 🔍 Retrospective (What We Learned)

Documents reflecting on the process, quality, and outcomes:

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[testing.md](testing.md)** | Testing strategy, coverage reports, quality metrics |
| **[lessons-learned.md](lessons-learned.md)** | Retrospective: what went well, what could improve |
| **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** | Detailed changelog of all changes during v0.1 |
| **[summary.md](summary.md)** | Executive summary and final version retrospective |
| **[lineage.md](lineage.md)** | Complete traceability from planning → decisions → implementation |

## Quick Links

### 🎯 Current Status
- **Status**: See "Implementation Status Summary" section above
- **Structure**: [structure.md](structure.md) - Understand the codebase organisation

### 📚 Key Resources
- **Decisions**: [decisions.md](decisions.md) - Why we made key architectural choices
- **Lessons**: [lessons-learned.md](lessons-learned.md) - What to carry forward to v0.2

### 📦 Archive
- **[archive/](archive/)** - Original working documents created during development
  - Preserved for transparency and historical reference
  - See the messy reality of iterative development
  - Contains: implementation guides, checklists, phase completion notes, skeleton summaries

## Using This as a Template

This structure is designed to be reusable for future versions (v0.2, v0.3, etc.). When starting a new version:

1. **Copy the structure**: Create `docs/development/devlog/vX.X/` with the same file set
2. **Update README.md**: Change version number, status, and implementation summary
3. **Start with Planning**: Fill in timeline.md and phases.md before coding
4. **Track Implementation**: Update decisions.md and implementation-notes.md as you go
5. **Capture Retrospective**: Complete lessons-learned.md and summary.md at the end
6. **Archive working docs**: Move any rough working documents to archive/ when done

### Separation of Concerns Benefits

- **Planning docs** help you think before coding
- **Implementation docs** track what actually happened
- **Retrospective docs** capture learnings for next time
- **Archive** shows the messy reality (important for transparency)

- **See the original working docs**: Explore [archive/](archive/)

## Contributing to This Log

When updating v0.1 documentation:

1. **Add changes to appropriate concern**:
   - Planning changes → timeline.md or phases.md
   - Implementation changes → structure.md or implementation-notes.md
   - Retrospective updates → lessons-learned.md, testing.md, or summary.md
   - Status updates → Update "Implementation Status Summary" in README.md

2. **Document decisions**: Add new architectural decisions to decisions.md

3. **Update CHANGELOG.md**: Record all notable changes

4. **Keep archive intact**: Don't modify files in archive/ - they're historical records

5. **Update README**: If structure changes, update this file's navigation

## Version Info

- **Version**: 0.1.0
- **Status**: Core implementation complete, phases 9-14 pending
- **Started**: November 2025
- **Core Complete**: November 9, 2025
- **Target Completion**: TBD (includes testing, security audit, documentation)

**About This Structure**: This development log uses a concern-based organisation (Planning/Implementation/Retrospective) to separate what was intended, what was done, and what was learned. This structure is designed to serve as a reusable template for all future ragged versions.
