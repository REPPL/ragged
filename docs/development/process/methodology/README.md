# Development Methodology

**Purpose:** Documentation of how ragged is developed with AI assistance and transparent time tracking.

---

## Overview

This directory contains documentation about ragged's development methodology, focusing on:

1. **AI Assistance** - How AI coding tools are used in development
2. **Time Tracking** - Transparent tracking of actual development time

---

## Philosophy

### Transparency First

We believe in documenting the actual development process, not an idealized version:

- ✅ Actual time spent (hours, not estimates)
- ✅ AI tool usage and effectiveness
- ✅ What worked and what didn't
- ✅ Learning outcomes and challenges
- ✅ Honest accounting of effort

### AI as Amplifier

AI tools amplify human expertise but don't replace it:

- All AI-generated code is reviewed and understood
- Critical paths are written manually
- Developers are accountable for all code
- AI effectiveness varies by task type

### Empirical Over Aspirational

We track reality, not ideals:

- Measure actual time, not estimates
- Document real decisions, not perfect ones
- Share failures alongside successes
- Learn from data, not assumptions

## Documents

### [AI Assistance](./ai-assistance.md)

Documents how AI tools are used in ragged development:

- Which tools (Claude Code, etc.)
- For what tasks (scaffolding, debugging, documentation)
- Effectiveness ratings by task type
- Guidelines for contributors using AI

### [Time Tracking](./time-tracking.md)

Explains how we track actual development time:

- Per-feature time logs with hour breakdowns
- AI vs. manual time comparison
- What counts as "development time"
- How to use time tracking templates

## For Researchers

This methodology documentation provides:

- **Quantitative data** on AI coding effectiveness
- **Reproducible process** for AI-assisted development
- **Case study material** for software engineering research
- **Honest assessment** of AI tools' strengths and limitations
