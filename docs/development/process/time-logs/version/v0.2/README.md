1. **Overview**: Release type, status, total time
2. **Time Breakdown**: Per-feature actual vs. estimated hours
3. **AI Assistance Analysis**: Effectiveness metrics by task type
4. **Comparison to Estimates**: Variance analysis
5. **Lessons Learned**: Insights for future planning

### AI Effectiveness Metrics

Time logs document:
- **Time Saved**: Percentage faster with AI assistance
- **Quality**: Assessment of AI-generated output
- **Task Type**: Which tasks benefit most from AI

### Estimation Improvement

Time logs feed back into planning:
- Identify consistently over/underestimated task types
- Refine future roadmap estimates
- Track estimation accuracy over releases
