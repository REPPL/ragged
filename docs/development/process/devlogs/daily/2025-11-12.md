- Revised v0.3.0: removed calendar references, added implementation note
- Revised v0.4.0: removed "Weeks 1-2/3-4/5-6", updated to British English
- Removed ALL calendar references from ALL roadmaps (113 instances → 0)
- Updated planning horizon: "~15 months" → "~850-1050 total hours"

**AI Assistance**:
- **Tool**: Claude Code
- **Tasks**: Find & replace calendar references, consistent formatting, British English conversion
- **Effectiveness**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### Task 3: Update Roadmap Overview

**Time Spent**: ~1 hour

**What was done**:
- Completely rewrote roadmap/version/README.md
- Added v0.2.3, v0.2.4, v0.2.6 with full descriptions
- Expanded v0.5.0, v0.6.0, v0.7.0 from brief mentions to full sections

- **Notes**: Perfect for structured data extraction and comprehensive documentation. Created professional time log from raw devlog data.

**Status:** Completed

---

### Task 5: Convert to British English

**Time Spent**: ~1 hour

- Patterns: optimise→optimise, organise→organise, analyse→analyse, normalise→normalise, specialise→specialise, personalise→personalise
- Used perl in-place editing with word boundary matching
- Verified zero American spellings remaining (grep -r verification)
- Affected files: roadmaps, devlogs, implementation plans, research docs, contributing guidelines

**AI Assistance**:
- **Tool**: Claude Code
- **Tasks**: Identify spelling patterns, create sed/perl commands, verify completeness
- **Effectiveness**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Notes**: Excellent at systematic text processing. Suggested perl over sed for reliability. Comprehensive pattern matching with word boundaries prevented false positives.

**Status:** Completed

## Decisions Made

### Decision: Split v0.2.5 into Three Priority-Based Versions

**Context**: Original v0.2.5 contained 16 bugs totalling 40-50 hours, too large for token-efficient AI sessions.

**Chosen Approach**: Split into v0.2.3 (P0, 12-15h), v0.2.4 (P1, 20-25h), v0.2.6 (P2, 12-19h).

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep v0.2.5 as single large version
- Split by functional area instead of priority
- Create v0.2.3-v0.2.8 (even smaller chunks)

**Rationale**:
- Priority-based splitting ensures critical bugs fixed first
- Each version fits within 1-2 focused AI sessions
- Clear dependencies (must complete P0 before P1)
- Commit boundaries align with priority levels

**ADR Created**: No - documented in v0.2.5/README.md as overview

---

### Decision: Use Hour-Based Planning Exclusively

**Context**: User requested removal of ALL calendar references (weeks, months, quarters) from roadmaps.

**Chosen Approach**: Replace all calendar references with AI implementation hours, show total planning in hours (~850-1050h to v1.0).

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep calendar estimates alongside hours
- Use "sprints" or other relative time units
- No time estimates at all

**Rationale**:
- AI implementation hours more accurate than calendar time
- Removes human calendar pressure
- Enables token-efficient session planning
- User explicitly requested hours-only approach

**ADR Created**: No - documented in planning methodology

---

### Decision: British English Throughout All Documentation

**Context**: Project standard is British English; existing docs had 113 American spellings.

**Chosen Approach**: Systematic conversion using perl with word boundaries across all 55 affected files.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Fix files incrementally as edited
- Only convert new/updated files
- Use automated linter/formatter

**Rationale**:
- Consistency across entire documentation set
- One-time comprehensive fix vs. ongoing inconsistency
- Perl with word boundaries more reliable than sed
- Verified zero American spellings remaining

**ADR Created**: No - coding standards decision

---

## Blockers and Challenges

### Challenge 1: sed vs. perl for British English Conversion

**How Addressed**:
- Initial attempt with sed on macOS had issues with in-place editing
- Switched to perl with `-i -pe` for reliable cross-file replacement
- Used word boundary `\b` to avoid false positives in technical terms

**Outcome**:
- Successfully converted 55 files with zero errors
- Verification showed zero American spellings remaining
- No false positives or broken technical terms

---

### Challenge 2: Large File Token Limits

**How Addressed**:
- Encountered file >25K tokens (personal-memory-systems.md)
- Used grep to find specific instances instead of reading entire file
- Applied perl replacement without needing to read full content

**Outcome**:
- Successfully updated large files without hitting token limits
- Learned to use targeted grep + perl for large file operations

---

## Code Quality

### Technical Debt

**Added**:
- None

**Paid Down**:

## Learning and Insights

### Technical Learnings

**New Skills/Knowledge**:
- Perl in-place editing more reliable than sed on macOS
- Word boundary `\b` regex prevents false positives in replacements
- grep + perl combination handles large files without reading into memory
- git log formatting for extracting specific commit history

**Resources Used**:
- perl documentation for in-place editing flags
- regex word boundary patterns
- git log filtering options

---

### Process Learnings

**What Worked Well**:
- Breaking work into clear sessions (Session 1: Create, Session 2: Revise, Session 3: British English)
- Using TodoWrite to track progress throughout
- Committing after each logical chunk (6 commits total)
- Verifying completion with grep before committing

**What Could Be Better**:
- Could have done British English conversion earlier in process (did it last)
- Initial sed attempts wasted ~10 minutes before switching to perl

---

### AI Usage Learnings

**Improved Prompting**:
- "Use British English" instruction at start ensured new content correct from beginning
- Providing specific patterns (optimise→optimise) helped AI understand requirements
- Asking for verification steps (grep commands) ensured completeness

**New AI Patterns**:
- AI excellent at maintaining structure across multiple similar documents
- Can handle complex multi-file operations with consistent formatting
- Understands context across long sessions (remembered British English requirement)
