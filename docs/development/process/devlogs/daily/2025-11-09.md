# Development Log - 2025-11-09

**Day of Week**: Sunday

**Total Coding Time**: 4.0 hours

**Energy Level**: Medium

**Focus Quality**: Good

---

## Summary

Collated documentation from raggedZero prototype into a structured implementation plan and set up the project's documentation architecture following best practices.

---

## Work Completed

### Feature/Task 1: Documentation Collation and Structure

**Time Spent**: 2.5 hours

**What was done**:
- Collated documentation from previous prototype (now called 'raggedZero') into implementation plan
- Organised new docs/ directory structure following existing design patterns
- Ensured documentation hierarchy aligns with best practices
- Set up templates for devlogs and time tracking

**AI Assistance**:
- **Tool**: Claude Code
- **Tasks**: Documentation structure validation, template creation
- **Effectiveness**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Notes**: Helpful for ensuring consistency and completeness of documentation structure

**Status:** Completed

### Feature/Task 2: Docker Environment Setup

**Time Spent**: 1.5 hours

**What was done**:
- Created Dockerfile with multi-stage Python 3.11-slim build
- Configured docker-compose.yml for ragged-app and chromadb services
- Added .dockerignore for build optimisation
- Attempted to resolve GPU access for Ollama

**AI Assistance**:
- **Tool**: Claude Code
- **Tasks**: Docker configuration, troubleshooting
- **Effectiveness**: ⭐⭐⭐
- **Notes**: Basic setup completed, GPU access issue remains

**Status:** Completed

**Update**: Successfully resolved - chromadb health check fixed by using bash's `/dev/tcp` instead of curl. Both containers now running properly.

---

## Decisions Made

### Decision: Documentation Structure

**Context**: Need to organise documentation from raggedZero prototype into maintainable structure for new implementation

**Chosen Approach**: Hierarchical docs/ directory with separate sections for development logs, time tracking, templates, and implementation plans

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Flat structure with all docs in one directory
- Wiki-based documentation

**Rationale**: Hierarchical structure provides better organisation for long-term maintenance and follows industry best practices for technical documentation

**ADR Created**: Not needed

---

## Blockers and Challenges

### Challenge 1: Docker Setup and Configuration

**Impact**: Initial Docker build failures and health check issues prevented containers from starting properly

**Time Lost**: 1.5 hours

**Resolution**:
- Fixed chromadb health check by replacing `curl` command with bash's `/dev/tcp` networking
- Removed obsolete `version` field from docker-compose.yml
- Both containers now running successfully (chromadb on :8001, ragged-app on :8000)

**Learnings**:
- Health checks should use commands available in the base image
- Bash's built-in `/dev/tcp` is useful for simple port checks when curl/wget unavailable
- Docker Desktop on macOS: Ollama running on host (via host.docker.internal) works well for GPU access

---

## Code Quality

### Tests Written

- [ ] No tests written today (documentation work)

### Code Review

- [ ] Self-review completed for Docker configs
- [ ] Type hints added (N/A)
- [ ] Docstrings complete (N/A)
- [ ] No linting errors

### Technical Debt

**Added**:
- ragged-app waiting for src/main.py implementation (planned for v0.1)

**Paid Down**:
- Docker health check configuration resolved
- Docker compose version warning eliminated

## AI Tool Effectiveness

### Tasks Where AI Helped

| Task | Tool | Time Saved (est.) | Quality | Notes |
|------|------|-------------------|---------|-------|
| Documentation structure | Claude Code | ~0.5h | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Good organisational suggestions |
| Docker configuration | Claude Code | ~0.5h | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Excellent troubleshooting and fix |
| Template creation | Claude Code | ~0.2h | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Comprehensive templates |
| Health check debugging | Claude Code | ~0.5h | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Identified and fixed curl issue quickly |

### Tasks Where AI Struggled

| Task | Tool | Issue | Resolution |
|------|------|-------|------------|
| N/A | N/A | No significant struggles today | N/A |

### Overall AI Effectiveness Today

**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ [1-5 stars]

**Percentage of AI-assisted time**: ~50%

**Estimated time saved vs. manual**: ~1.7 hours

**Best use cases today**:
- Docker troubleshooting and debugging
- Documentation structure planning
- Container health check configuration

**Worst use cases today**:
- None identified today

---

## Learning and Insights

### Technical Learnings

**New Skills/Knowledge**:
- Bash's `/dev/tcp` pseudo-device for network connectivity checks
- Docker health check configuration and debugging
- Documentation structure best practices for RAG systems
- ChromaDB containerisation

**Resources Used**:
- Docker Compose health check documentation
- Bash networking built-ins reference

### Process Learnings

**What Worked Well**:
- Systematic approach to documentation organisation
- Using templates for consistency
- Methodical Docker debugging (checking logs, testing commands in container)
- Leveraging AI for troubleshooting Docker health checks

**What Could Be Better**:
- Could have verified health check commands exist in base image earlier
- Testing containers immediately after docker-compose.yml creation

### AI Usage Learnings

**Improved Prompting**:
- Providing specific error messages enables faster troubleshooting
- Allowing AI to explore container internals (checking available commands) accelerates debugging

**New AI Patterns**:
- Using AI for systematic Docker debugging (logs → container inspection → solution)
- Leveraging AI's knowledge of alternative approaches (e.g., `/dev/tcp` vs curl)

## Tomorrow's Plan

### Priority Tasks

1. **Build v0.1 from documentation** - Implement core RAG functionality based on collated specs - Est. 6.0 hours
2. **Set up testing framework** - Prepare for TDD workflow - Est. 1.0 hours
3. **Create initial API endpoints** - FastAPI routes for RAG operations - Est. 2.0 hours

### Blockers to Address

- None - development environment fully operational

### Dependencies

- ✅ Docker environment stable and operational
- ✅ Ollama models available and tested (8 models ready)
- ✅ ChromaDB running and healthy
