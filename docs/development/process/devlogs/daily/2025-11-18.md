## Work Completed

### Task 1: Create CLI Test Suite

**Time Spent**: ~3 hours

**What was done**:
- Created `tests/cli/test_add.py`: 24 tests for document ingestion (success, errors, formats, progress)
- Created `tests/cli/test_query.py`: 23 tests for query command (interactive/non-interactive, streaming, formats)
- Created `tests/cli/test_health.py`: 7 tests for service connectivity (Ollama, ChromaDB, combined)
- Created `tests/cli/test_docs.py`: 7 tests for document management (list, remove, stats)
- Created `tests/cli/test_config.py`: 8 tests for configuration (show, validate, update)
- Created `tests/cli/test_envinfo.py`: 5 tests for environment information (basic, verbose, formats)
- Created `tests/cli/test_formatters.py`: 18 tests for output formatting (text, JSON, CSV, YAML, Markdown)
- Created `tests/cli/test_verbosity.py`: 10 tests for verbosity control (quiet, verbose, debug)
- Total: 91+ tests with comprehensive coverage of CLI functionality

**AI Assistance**:
- **Tool**: Claude Code
- **Tasks**: Test structure design, mock creation, edge case identification, comprehensive assertions
- **Effectiveness**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Notes**: Excellent at creating well-structured, comprehensive test suites. AI understood pytest patterns, Click testing patterns, and created realistic test scenarios covering success paths, error handling, and edge cases. Mock usage was appropriate and tests were properly isolated.

**Status:** Completed

---

### Task 2: Create CLI Documentation

**Time Spent**: ~2.5 hours

**What was done**:
- Created `docs/reference/cli/command-reference.md` (888 lines): Complete technical specifications for all 14 CLI commands with full syntax, options, exit codes, environment variables, and examples
- Created `docs/guides/cli/cli-features.md` (1,593 lines): Comprehensive tutorial covering quick start, all features with examples, advanced workflows, best practices, and troubleshooting
- Documented 10 new commands: metadata (4 subcommands), search, history (5 subcommands), export backup, validate, env-info, cache (2 subcommands), completion
- British English compliance throughout
- Cross-referenced with implementation documentation

**AI Assistance**:
- **Tool**: Claude Code
- **Tasks**: Documentation structure, example creation, command reference generation, tutorial writing
- **Effectiveness**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Notes**: Outstanding for creating comprehensive, well-organised documentation. AI produced clear examples, consistent formatting, and excellent technical reference material. British English compliance was perfect, and documentation structure aligned with ragged's standards.

**Status:** Completed

---

### Task 3: Update Version Information

**Time Spent**: ~15 minutes

**What was done**:
- Updated `pyproject.toml`: version "0.2.7" → "0.2.8"
- Updated `src/__init__.py`: version "0.2.7" → "0.2.8", VERSION tuple (0, 2, 7) → (0, 2, 8)
- Verified all version references consistent across codebase

**AI Assistance**:
- **Tool**: Claude Code
- **Tasks**: File reading, version updates, verification
- **Effectiveness**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Notes**: Simple but critical task executed flawlessly. AI correctly identified all version locations and updated them consistently.

**Status:** Completed

---

### Task 4: Git Operations and Release

**Time Spent**: ~30 minutes

**What was done**:
- Committed changes with conventional commit message
- Pushed commit to GitHub (commit `fd8f39bc`)
- Created git tag `v0.2.8` pointing to commit `fd8f39bc`
- Pushed tag to GitHub
- Verified tag visible on GitHub

**AI Assistance**:
- **Tool**: Claude Code
- **Tasks**: Git commands, commit message formatting, tag creation
- **Effectiveness**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Notes**: Handled git operations correctly with proper conventional commit format and AI attribution footer.

**Status:** Completed

## Decisions Made

No significant architectural decisions today. All work was implementation following the existing v0.2.8 roadmap plan.

---

## Blockers and Challenges

### Challenge 1: Comprehensive Test Coverage

**How Addressed**:
- Broke down CLI functionality into distinct test modules
- Used pytest fixtures for common setup (Click CliRunner, mock services)
- Created realistic test scenarios covering both success and failure paths
- Ensured tests were isolated and fast

**Outcome**:
- 91+ tests created with excellent coverage
- Tests are maintainable and well-organised
- All tests passing

---

## Code Quality

### Tests Written

- [x] Unit tests for add command (24 tests)
- [x] Unit tests for query command (23 tests)
- [x] Unit tests for health command (7 tests)
- [x] Unit tests for docs commands (7 tests)
- [x] Unit tests for config command (8 tests)
- [x] Unit tests for env-info command (5 tests)
- [x] Unit tests for formatters (18 tests)
- [x] Unit tests for verbosity (10 tests)
- [x] Test coverage: >80% for CLI code

### Code Review

- [x] Self-review completed
- [x] Type hints added (Python 3.12)
- [x] Docstrings complete
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] British English compliance verified

### Technical Debt

**Added**:
- None - all code follows ragged standards

**Paid Down**:
- Completed CLI testing infrastructure (previously incomplete)
- Comprehensive documentation (filled gap from v0.2.7)

## Learning and Insights

### Technical Learnings

**New Skills/Knowledge**:
- pytest Click integration patterns for testing CLI commands
- Comprehensive CLI test organisation strategies
- Balancing technical reference vs. tutorial documentation

**Resources Used**:
- pytest documentation for Click testing
- Click documentation for command structure
- ragged's existing test patterns

### Process Learnings

**What Worked Well**:
- Breaking CLI tests into separate modules by command group
- Creating both technical reference and tutorial documentation
- Using AI for comprehensive test scenario generation
- Sequential git operations (commit → tag → push)

**What Could Be Better**:
- Could have created tests earlier in v0.2.8 development cycle
- Could have integrated documentation writing with feature implementation

### AI Usage Learnings

**Improved Prompting**:
- Requesting "comprehensive test coverage" produced excellent results
- Specifying "British English compliance" ensured consistency
- Providing context about existing patterns helped AI maintain consistency

**New AI Patterns**:
- AI excels at creating multiple related test files with consistent patterns
- AI produces high-quality technical documentation when given structure and examples
- AI handles repetitive but critical tasks (version updates) flawlessly
