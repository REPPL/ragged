## Overview

This directory contains archived development materials from the v0.1 implementation phase.

**Contents:** Draft notes, experimental designs, and historical documentation preserved for reference.

---

## Note

Most v0.1 development documentation has been organised into:
- [v0.1 Development Log](../README.md) - Main narrative
- [v0.1 Decisions Index](../decisions-index.md) - All decisions
- [v0.1 Implementation Records](../../../../../implementation/version/v0.1/) - Final results

This archive contains supplementary materials that provide additional context but aren't part of the primary documentation.
