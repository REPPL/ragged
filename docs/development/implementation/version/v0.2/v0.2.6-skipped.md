# v0.2.6 - Skipped/Deferred

**Status:** ⏭️ SKIPPED
**Date:** November 2025
**Reason:** Features already implemented or deferred

---

## Why v0.2.6 Was Skipped

During v0.2.7 planning, it became apparent that:

1. **Features already implemented** - Some planned v0.2.6 features were already completed in earlier versions (v0.2.2-v0.2.5)
2. **Natural evolution** - The CLI refactoring in v0.2.7 made v0.2.6 scope redundant
3. **Better organisation** - Combining CLI refactoring (v0.2.7) with CLI enhancements (v0.2.8) created a more logical release sequence

### Deferred to v0.2.9

**Performance Optimisations** ⏭️ v0.2.9

## Version Sequence

The actual version progression was:

```
v0.2.5 (Quality improvements)
   ↓
[v0.2.6 - SKIPPED]
   ↓
v0.2.7 (CLI refactoring + folder/HTML features)
   ↓
v0.2.8 (CLI enhancements - 10 features)
   ↓
v0.2.9 (Performance optimisations) [PLANNED]
```

---

## Impact

**No impact on users or functionality.** The features users would have received in v0.2.6 were either:
- Already available in earlier versions
- Delivered in v0.2.7 and v0.2.8 with better implementation

This resulted in a cleaner, more logical version progression.
