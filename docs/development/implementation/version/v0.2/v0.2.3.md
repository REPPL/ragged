# v0.2.3 Implementation Record - SKIPPED

**Status:** SKIPPED
**Date:** 2025-11-17
**Category:** Critical Bug Fixes (P0)

---

## Summary

Version v0.2.3 was originally planned as the first post-v0.2.2 release, focusing on critical P0 bugs that would block core functionality. However, this version was **skipped** in favour of addressing issues incrementally across v0.2.4 and v0.2.5.

---

## Why Skipped

### Strategic Decision

The decision to skip v0.2.3 was made for the following reasons:

1. **Incremental Approach**: Critical bugs were better addressed alongside related improvements in v0.2.4 and v0.2.5
2. **Token Efficiency**: Splitting bugs by priority (P0/P1/P2) across v0.2.3/v0.2.4/v0.2.6 proved less efficient than thematic grouping
3. **Natural Resolution**: Many critical issues were resolved as side-effects of implementing v0.2.4 improvements

### Planned vs Actual

**Planned Critical Issues (v0.2.3):**
- BUG-001: API endpoints non-functional
- BUG-002: Logger undefined in settings.py
- BUG-003: Zero test coverage for new modules

**Actual Resolution:**
- BUG-001: Fixed during API refactoring in v0.2.4
- BUG-002: Resolved by settings refactoring in v0.2.5 (QUALITY-001)
- BUG-003: Addressed by comprehensive test additions in v0.2.4 and v0.2.5

## Impact on Roadmap

### Versions Affected

- **v0.2.3**: SKIPPED
- **v0.2.4**: Absorbed some critical bug fixes from v0.2.3 plan
- **v0.2.5**: Absorbed logger/settings issues from v0.2.3 plan

### Timeline Impact

**Original Plan:**
```
v0.2.2 → v0.2.3 (12-15h) → v0.2.4 (20-25h) → v0.2.6 (12-19h)
Total: 44-59h across 3 releases
```

**Actual:**
```
v0.2.2 → v0.2.4 (released 2025-11-17) → v0.2.5 (released 2025-11-17)
Total: ~35h across 2 releases
```

**Result:** More efficient implementation, faster delivery to users

## Lessons Learnt

### Positive Outcomes

1. **Thematic Grouping Works Better**: Grouping by functionality (exceptions, paths, quality) rather than priority (P0/P1/P2) led to more coherent releases
2. **Natural Dependencies**: Bugs naturally resolved alongside related improvements
3. **Faster Delivery**: Skipping intermediate release reduced overhead

### For Future Planning

1. **Flexible Roadmaps**: Version plans should be guidelines, not rigid requirements
2. **Merge When Logical**: Small related versions can be merged for efficiency
3. **User Value Focus**: Prioritise delivering complete, coherent functionality over strict version adherence
