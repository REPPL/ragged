## Major Inspirations

### **Autonomous Agentic RAG** by Fareed Khan
Self-improving RAG system with evolutionary optimisation and multi-agent orchestration.

**Influenced**:
- v0.5.1: Differentiated model strategy
- v0.5.2, v0.6.1: Self-improving query strategies
- v1.x: Multi-agent orchestration
- v2.x: Compliance frameworks

### **LEANN** - Graph-Based Vector Storage
97% storage savings through selective recomputation.

**Influenced**:
- v0.4.9: LEANN backend integration

**Source**: https://github.com/davidsandberg/leann
**Details**: [docs/development/acknowledgements/leann.md](docs/development/acknowledgements/leann.md)

## Memory & Knowledge Graph Patterns

**Mem0** - Personalised memory layer
**Graphiti** (Zep AI) - Temporal knowledge graphs
**Letta** - Stateful LLM agents

These projects influenced ragged's v0.4.x memory system design.

## Research Papers

### **Context Engineering 2.0** by GAIR
Theoretical framework positioning context engineering as entropy reduction.

**Influenced**:
- v0.4.4-v0.4.8: Knowledge graphs as structured context layers
- v0.4.6: Context-aware personalised ranking
- v0.6.0: Dynamic context adaptation and compression

**Source**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26493
